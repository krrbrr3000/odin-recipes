# odin-recipes
This is a practice recipe site I'm using to learn HTML 
It will consist of a main index about the theme of the recipes as well as several links to recipes
I will post pictures for each recipe using img src to use images from both the internet and local files
It will not be pretty, yet, because I have not learned CSS but it will suffice
