        <li> 1 teaspoon baking soda </li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li> 1 cup sweetened shredded coconut </li>

    <h2> Instructions: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside. </li>
        <li> In a large bowl, beat the softened butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together until creamy and smooth, about 2-3 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract. </li>
        <li> In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until just combined. Do not overmix. Fold in the shredded coconut, chocolate chips, and nuts if using. The dough will be thick. </li>
        <li> Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Gently flatten each ball of dough with the palm of your hand or the back of a spoon to form a disc shape. </li>
        <li> Bake for 10-12 minutes,
