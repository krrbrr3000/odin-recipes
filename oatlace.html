    <p> This is the best cookie I will ever make </p>
    <br>
    <h2> Ingredients: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly </li>
        <li> 1 cup packed light brown sugar </li>
        <li> 1/4 cup light corn syrup </li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
        <li> 1 1/2 cups old-fashioned rolled oats </li>
        <li> 1 cup all-purpose flour </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2> Instructions: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside. </li>
        <li> In a large bowl, whisk together the melted butter, brown sugar, corn syrup, salt, and vanilla until smooth. Add the oats and flour and stir until just combined. The dough will be very wet. </li>
        <li> Drop heaping tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 3 inches apart. Using the back of a spoon or your fingers, spread each mound of dough into a thin circle about 3 inches in diameter. The cookies will spread a lot during baking, so make sure to leave enough space between them. </li>
        <li> Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the centers are set. Rotate the baking sheets halfway through baking to ensure even cooking. </li>
        <li> Remove from the oven and let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. The cookies will crisp up as they cool. </li>
        <li> Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to one week. Enjoy! </li>
    </ol>
